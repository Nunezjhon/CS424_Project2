# File   : (AggregateAndOutput.r) PreProcessing commands for project #2 Every Breath You Take                                        #
# About  : The CSV files taken off of the EPA website are very large and take sometime to process into a dataframe.                  #
#          By aggregating the files into 2 dataframes before hand then outputting into a feather format using the feather library,   #
#          we are able to decrease loading times by a considerable amount.                                                           #
#          Below you could follow the steps and instructions to use in your own R application.                                       #
