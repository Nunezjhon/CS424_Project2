<h5> Instructions </h5>

Our application allows the user to start by picking a year, county and state they would like to visualize.
These can be chosen by a drop down menu which updates as the user clicks on a state or year to show only the information for which there exists data.
Our app functions for all years of all counties for yearly and daily data thus fulfilling B and C level requirements about data downloading. Also functions for hourly data which we will discuss later.
